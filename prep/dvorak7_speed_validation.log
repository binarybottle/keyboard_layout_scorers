BIGRAM CORRELATION ANALYSIS: RAW vs FREQUENCY-ADJUSTED
========================================================================================================================
Note: Negative correlation = higher score ‚Üí faster typing (validates Dvorak)
      Positive correlation = higher score ‚Üí slower typing (contradicts Dvorak)
